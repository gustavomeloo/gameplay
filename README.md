<h1 align="center">Gameplay ðŸŽ®</h1>

<p align="center">  
"Gameplay" is an application to organize the games you will play together with your friends.
</p>
<p>
Gameplay is a joint project with RocketSeat on the 6th edition of NLW - Together.</br>
Made in react-native and applied in TypeScript, Gameplay uses many react-native libraries and an integration with Discord App.</br>
This integration will be done using Discord Developer where we will create an application, in order to use the Discord API and make the necessary requests for the application
</p>
<p>
This project aims to organize your games with your friends. In the application we will set the time, day, game and much more that we will play.</br>
All of this has the help of discord, which is usually the place where you and your friends get together to play a game and have fun.
